# Collaborative-TwinFork-Robot-Simulation
TwinFork Robot is a type of forklift-like mobile robot composed of two coordinated "fork arms" that work together to transport pallets. In this repository, we designed a cooperative control system, implemented collaborative behaviors between the robots, and simulated the entire system using Gazebo Classic.
